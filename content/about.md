# Hi there

My name is Josh and I'm a software engineer. I work on all manner of things across mobile, web, and backend apps.

Right now, my main interest is improving the developer experience and making development more accessible to take code from laptop to production.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/kasuboski) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshkasuboski/)

Here is a [resume](/resume.html)
